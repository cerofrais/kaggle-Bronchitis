# kaggle-Bronchitis
Dataset has X-ray images and task is to classify is the patient has Bronchitis or not.

In V1: first attempt.

In preprocessing i learned that most of the pytorch models have a dataset_loader module which has a predefined format on how your data set should look like so. first re organised my dataset to test and val folders with classes seperated.

Started with pretrained weights of Alexnet. edited classifier to predict 2 classes.

Sent the sample images i have and trained the weights for 50 epocs.

Finally made a submission file as required.
